# Boxes: GameplayKit Entity-Component Basics

This sample demonstrates how to use GameplayKitâ€™s entity-component feature to create modular, scalable game architecture. It covers the classes `GKEntity`, `GKComponent`, and `GKComponentSystem`. 

## Structure

The Game object sets up the entities and their components. Each box is represented by an instance of the `GKEntity` class -- an abstract container for the `GKComponent` objects that together provide each entity's functionality.

Each box shows the effect of a different combination of the following components:
- All boxes have a `GeometryComponent` that manage their SceneKit representation for display and physics simulator.
- Boxes with a `ParticleComponent` also display a fiery or sparkly particle effect.
- Boxes with a `PlayerControlComponent` jump up into the air when you interact with the scene.

In the `Game` object's `setUpEntities` method, try adding a particle or player-control component to the purple box. 

## Playing the game

Tap anywhere (iOS), press any key (OS X), or click the Siri Remote touch surface (tvOS) to interact with the scene, causing boxes with a `PlayerControlComponent` to jump.
